# SPA<sub>GRM</sub> introduction

SPA<sub>GRM</sub> is a scalable, accurate, and universal analysis framework to control for sample relatedness in large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In the paper ```A scalable, accurate, and universal analysis framework to control for sample relatedness in large-scale genome-wide association studies and its application to 79 longitudinal traits in UK Biobank (to be updated)```, we applied SPA<sub>GRM</sub> to analyze 79 longitudinal traits extracted from UK Biobank primary care data. As a universal analysis framework, we also evaluated SPA<sub>GRM</sub>'s performance in quantitative and binary trait analysis. 

**SPA<sub>GRM</sub> is now implemented in the [GRAB package](https://wenjianbi.github.io/grab.github.io/). Please click here to download.**

**Detailed documentation about how to use SPA<sub>GRM</sub> is available at [SPA<sub>GRM</sub> documentation](https://fantasy-xuhe.github.io/SPAGRM.github.io/).**

**Summary statistics of 79 longitudinal traits extracted from UK Biobank primary care data is available at [here](https://zenodo.org/records/10242062).**
