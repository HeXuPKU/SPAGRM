# SPA<sub>GRM</sub> introduction

SPA<sub>GRM</sub> is a scalable, accurate, and universal analysis framework to control for sample relatedness in large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In the paper ```A scalable, accurate, and universal analysis framework to control for sample relatedness in large-scale genome-wide association studies and its application to 79 longitudinal traits in UK Biobank (to be updated)```, we applied SPA<sub>GRM</sub> to analyze 79 longitudinal traits extracted from UK Biobank primary care data. As a universal analysis framework, we also evaluated SPA<sub>GRM</sub>'s performance in quantitative and binary trait analysis. 

SPA<sub>GRM</sub> is a two-step method to control for sample relatedness like many other popular methods, such as [BOLT-LMM](https://alkesgroup.broadinstitute.org/BOLT-LMM/BOLT-LMM_manual.html), [SAIGE](https://saigegit.github.io/SAIGE-doc/), [fastGWA](https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/#Overview), [REGENIE](https://rgcgithub.github.io/regenie/), [GATE](https://github.com/weizhou0/GATE), and [POLMM](https://github.com/WenjianBI/POLMM).

SPA<sub>GRM</sub> is now implemented in the [GRAB package](https://wenjianbi.github.io/grab.github.io/)
